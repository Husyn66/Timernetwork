# ⏳ Timer

**Timer** is a next-generation social network where **time = reward**.  
User engagement (likes, views, and activity) is converted into **points**, and in the future — into real tokens (**QNX on Polygon**).  

## 🚀 MVP (0–90 days)
- Like-to-points reward system  
- Basic AI assistant for moderation and recommendations  
- Simple and responsive web interface  

## 🔮 Future Development
- Points exchangeable for QNX tokens  
- AI-powered content moderation  
- Automatic multi-language translation  
- Mobile application (Flutter/React Native)  
- NFT badges for active users  
- DAO governance for community decisions  

## 📊 Current Status
- ✅ MVP website launched  
- 🚧 Tokenization in progress  
- 🧠 AI integration planned
